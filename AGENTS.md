# Working on this Marin application

## Architecture

This is a static, zero-build MarinOS application. It uses the shared `marin-ui` brand bundle (vendored via `marin-ui/scripts/sync-consumer.sh`, version recorded in `BRAND_VERSION`) and follows `marin-digital-standards`. See `marin.yml` for this project's owner, status, and platform versions.

## Before making UI changes

1. Check `marin-ui/docs/components.md` for an existing pattern before writing new CSS or JS.
2. Prefer existing semantic tokens over raw values.
3. Keep the default view immediately functional — info/how-to content belongs in the About tab, not stacked above or alongside the tool.

## Before finishing

There is no automated check command yet. Manually verify against the review checklist in `marin-skills/marin-app-builder/SKILL.md`: metadata placeholders replaced, nav includes About and Updates (plus Home if the default view has no task tab of its own), accessibility basics, no invented components.
